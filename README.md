# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:** 

As many employees in Pewlett Hackard are expected to retire soon, we wanted to analyze the numbers more deeply to understand the amount of employees by title, as well as employees who would be eligible for a mentorship program. 

**Results:**  

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
1. Overall, there are approximately 72,000 employees that are due for retirement
2. 36% of these employees are Senior Engineers, followed by 34% of the total being other Senior Staff

3. When looking at employees eligible for mentorship, we found 1,549
4. Most of the mentorship eligible employees fell under the staff title, followed by the Senior Engineer title

**Summary:**  
    -  There is a very large amount of roles that are ready to be retired. To make an impact, at least 50% of those roles should be replaced, which would equate to about 36,000 positions. 
    - It does not seem like there are enough employees to mentor and grow the newer members of the company
    - Two additional queries that would be helpful in this analysis are:
	    1. Retirees by year and title so that HR can focus their efforts on the proper titles and true impact can be assessed by time period
	    2. A complete employee list by year with hire dates that would allow leaders within the organization to see where any patterns are and the gap is widening between new employees and employees leaving the company. They could use this data to assess if that position needs to be updated or changed, or if salary or other components may be limiting the interest pool
